    {University of Oxford}
    {Jul. 2016 – Sep. 2016}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Used a variety of machine learning techniques during my internship within the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance, working on a project to detect mosquito presence, species, and gender from audio recordings.}
        \item {Developed a fully-featured python package to act as a test-bed for detection algorithms, aimed for a public open source release. This has improved my skills in coding for a long term project where the code will be further used and worked on by others.}
        \item {Planned and carried out a series of microphone tests to characterise and determine which offers superior detection performance. This resulted in a large batch of microphones being purchased and used to capture further biological recordings.}
        \item {Continuing work on this within my fourth year project, with plans to build high-level server-side and Android implementations as well as low level custom micro-controller implementations.}
